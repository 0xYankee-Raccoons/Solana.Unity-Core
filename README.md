# What is Solnet?

Solnet is Solana's .NET integration library.

Solnet was developed targeting net 5.0 because we believe a modern decentralized platform deserves a modern technology framework to go along with it, although we are actively working on targeting earlier versions such as:

- netstandard 1.1 
- netstandard 2.0 
- netcore 2.1
- netcore 3.1 
- net451
